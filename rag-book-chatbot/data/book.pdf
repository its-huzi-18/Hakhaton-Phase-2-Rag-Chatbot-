This is a sample book for testing the RAG chatbot.

Chapter 1: Introduction to RAG Systems
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It combines information retrieval with text generation to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

Chapter 2: How RAG Works
The RAG system first retrieves relevant documents based on the user's query. Then, it uses these documents as context to generate a response. This ensures that the answers are grounded in actual data.

Chapter 3: Benefits of RAG
RAG systems provide more accurate answers by grounding them in real documents. They can handle out-of-domain queries better than traditional generative models.

Chapter 4: Applications
RAG systems are commonly used in question-answering systems, customer support, and document analysis.

Chapter 5: Limitations
While RAG systems are powerful, they depend heavily on the quality of the source documents. If the source material doesn't contain the answer, the system cannot generate it.
