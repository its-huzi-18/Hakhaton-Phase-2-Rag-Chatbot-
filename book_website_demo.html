        <div class="section">
            <h2>Introduction to Robotics</h2>
            <p>Robotics is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that includes mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and others. It deals with the design, construction, operation, and use of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.</p>

            <p>These technologies are used to develop machines that can substitute for humans. Robots can be used in any situation and for any purpose, but today many are used in dangerous environments (including bomb detection and deactivation), manufacturing processes, or where humans cannot survive.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Artificial Intelligence in Robotics</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) in robotics involves the development of algorithms and systems that enable robots to perceive, reason, learn, and act autonomously or semi-autonomously in real-world environments. This includes machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and other AI techniques.</p>

            <p>Modern AI-powered robots can adapt to new situations, learn from experience, and make decisions based on sensory input. They can perform complex tasks that previously required human intelligence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Machine Learning for Robotic Control</h2>
            <p>Machine learning algorithms allow robots to improve their performance through experience. Common approaches include reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.</p>

            <p>Reinforcement learning is particularly useful for robotic control, as it allows robots to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error, receiving rewards for successful actions and penalties for unsuccessful ones.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Computer Vision in Robotics</h2>
            <p>Computer vision enables robots to interpret and understand visual information from the world around them. This includes object recognition, scene understanding, navigation, and manipulation tasks.</p>

            <p>Modern computer vision systems use deep learning techniques to achieve human-level performance in many visual tasks, making robots more capable and versatile in unstructured environments.</p>
